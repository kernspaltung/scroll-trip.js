# To-Do List:

- Fix Layer Click:
   - elements should now have a class 'scroll-travel-element'
   - jquery should know if they're visible:
      - show them
      - enable click
      - run animations
- Add a quick pause before scrolling to next level
- Fix precision so levels always reach their end before scrolling
- Hide non visible levels
- BUG fix: scrollTotal grows larger than totalH
